title: Complete and Partial Dentures
---

Dentures are natural-looking replacement teeth that are removable. There are two types of dentures: full and partial. Full dentures are given to patients when all of the natural teeth have been removed. Dentures can also be supported by implants, in which case they are fixed to the jaw bones and not removable by the patient.  Partial dentures are attached to a metal frame that is connected to your natural teeth and are used to fill in where permanent teeth have been removed. Just like natural teeth, dentures need to be properly cared for. Use a gentle cleanser to brush your dentures, always keep them moist when theyâ€™re not in use, and be sure to keep your tongue and gums clean as well.
