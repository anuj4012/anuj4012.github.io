title: Scaling and Polishing
---

The first line of defense against gum disease is a unique type of cleaning called scaling and root planing.‚Äù In this procedure, an ultrasonic cleaning device is used to remove plaque and tartar from your teeth where regular cleaning devices can't reach: under the gum line, on the tooth, and around the root. Then, the rough surface of the tooth and the root are smoothed out (planned). This provides a healthy, clean surface that makes it easier for the gum tissue to reattach to the tooth.  All of the dental hygienists at Commonwealth Dental Group are experts in this procedure.
If you address your gum disease before it becomes severe, scaling and root planing may be the only treatment you need. However, as with any dental procedure, after-care is vital. In order to keep your teeth in good shape and resist future occurrences of gum disease, you must brush and floss daily, eat a healthy diet, avoid tobacco use, and have regular dental checkups. Even after a successful scaling and root planing, if you don't attend to your teeth properly, it's quite likely that you'll develop gum disease again.
